        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, 
        weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies 
        of World Wide Web content engineering. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, 
        including video games.
